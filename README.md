# Device/Scene Controller Example

This SmartApp hosts a web page that allows the control of scenes, locks, and switches. 
It's an example of how to:
* Execute scenes
* Execute device commands
* Subscribe to device state change events by capability
* Store the auth tokens and settings of installed app instances and use them when making calls to the
SmartThings API that are not in response to SmartApp lifecycle events.

## File Structure

* lib/db.js &mdash; module for listing installed app instances from the context store
* lib/smartapp.js &mdash; the SmartApp implementation
* lib/sse.js &mdash; Server-Sent Event object used to update the web page  
* locales/en.json &mdash; English version of the app configuration page text
* public/images &mdash; web image files
* public/javascript &mdash; web page JavaScript files
* public/stylesheets &mdash; web page css files
* server.js &mdash; the Express server that hosts the SmartApp as a web-hook
* views/index.ejs &mdash; the home page
* views/isa.ejs &mdash; the installed app instance control page

## Prerequisites
- A [Samsung Developer Workspace account](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/workspace/)

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed

- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or similar tool to create a secure tunnel to a publically available URL
  
## Getting Started

### Clone this GitHub repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/device-scene-example-nodejs.git
```

### Start the server
```bash
cd device-scene-example-nodejs
npm install
node server.js
```

### Start ngrok and point it to your server
```
ngrok http localhost:3001
```
Make note of the HTTPS forwarding URL, for example `https://c79461932dfc.ngrok.io`

### Create an automation in the developer workspace

Go to the SmartThings developer workspace and create an Automation SmartApp. This app should have the scopes:
```
r:devices:*
x:devices:*
r:scenes:*
x:scenes:*
```
Choose the web-hook option when creating the app. The _targetURI_ should be set to the ngrok forwarding
URL, for example `https://c79461932dfc.ngrok.io`

Take note of the `appId`, `clientId`, and `clientSecret` displayed after creating your app.

### Confirm that your app is ready to receive lifecycle events

Look in your server log for a line with a URL to use for verifying your app. Visit this URL to confirm
the location of your app (you can do this in a web browser).

### Create a .env file and restart the server

Create a file named `.env` in the project directory that sets your `appId`, `clientId`, and `clientSecret`.
For example:
```
APP_ID=912e0214-5706-4407-a299-b3796a57cf56
CLIENT_ID=61225bef-d2db-4ab0-82f6-d28c0f11911d
CLIENT_SECRET=94c2b3df-b0ab-4abd-84bf-1823d63b944c
```

and restart your NodeJS server. Do not restart ngrok or the URL will change (unless your are using a 
paid account)

### Install your SmartApp and visit the web page

Install your SmartApp using the SmartThings mobile app. Then visit your local web server
to see and control devices and scenes.

http://localhost:3001
